# baddies

baddies is a simple traditional grid like game for the terminal. It has movement, monsters, overhead view, and walls comparable to traditional roguelikes such as NetHack.

This game was originally made as a project at UIC, Fall 2023. I plan to flesh it out more into my own game that can possibly become more detailed with some unique ideas.

The goal is to get the exit of the dungeon (represented by a *).

## Roadmap:
